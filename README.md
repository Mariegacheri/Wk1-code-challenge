# Review: WK1-CODE-CHALLENGE

## Learning Goals
- Practise the use of 'if', 'if else', and 'else' in this code challenge.

## Instructions

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account. 

NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution.

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges.

 

### Tests

Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 


 
 Challenge 2: Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

Write a program that takes the speed of a car.


Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

### Structure

The structure of this lab — where its files and folders are located
— looks roughly like the following:

``` text
├── README.md
├── netSalary.js
└── speedDetector.js
└── studentGradeGenerator.js
```

### Code Along

Open up `index.js` in your text editor; you should see, well, nothing. We'll fix
that soon.
Use java script tp write down the solutions
1. Student Grade Generator.
   -Create a code that generates the grade of students by just entering the marks and the students username.
   Use the 'if', 'if else', and 'else' staments to code along this challenge. 
   The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below: 

        A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

2. Speed Detector.
   -This code takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
3. Net Salary Calculator.
   -This code majors in an individuals's Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary. 


Don't worry too much yet if it's hard to understand what is happening in this test. But it's a good idea to open up the file, and
gather the information that you can. We will also provide instructions in the
`README.md` file that will allow you to complete the lab.
